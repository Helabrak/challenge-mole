# SKIN CANCER DETECTION APP

## Description
### Skin Cancer Definition and Types: 
- Most skin cancers are locally destructive cancerous (malignant) growth of the skin. They originate from the cells of the epidermis, the superficial layer of the skin and the majority of them rarely spread to other parts of the body and become life-threatening. 
- There are three major types of skin cancer: (1) basal cell carcinoma (the most common), (2) squamous cell carcinoma (the second most common) and (3) melanoma
- The images used for this CNN excercise cover two cancerous types;bcc and mel,together with another 5 benign types; Akiec,Bkl,Df,Nv,and Vasc

# The Dataset

The dataset used for the model can be found at  https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000 
It was created by Tschandl et al. 2018. 


# About this app
This app has build a model that applied a CNN and Keras to diagnose the mole images.

Before building the model, some steps has completed:
** Step 1. Preprocessing data for computer vision **

** We have deployed an app that could predict whether the image detected/loaded is cancerous or benign
